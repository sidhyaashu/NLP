## 🛠 PROCEDURE IN NLP

1. **Import General Libraries and NLP Modules**
   - Libraries like `NLTK` and `SpaCy` are commonly used.

2. **Load the Dataset** 📂

3. **Text Preprocessing** 🧹
   - Removing HTML tags.
   - Removing punctuations.
   - Performing stemming.
   - Removing stop words.
   - Expanding contractions.

4. **Apply Tokenization** ✂️

5. **Apply Stemming** 🌱

6. **Apply POS Tagging** 🏷️

7. **Apply Lemmatization** 📚

8. **Apply Label Encoding** 🔢

9. **Feature Extraction** 🛠️

10. **Text to Numerical Vector Conversion** 🔄
    - Apply **BOW** (Count-Vectorizer).
    - Apply **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
    - Apply **Word2Vec Vectorizer**.
    - Apply **GloVe**.

11. **Data Preprocessing** 🔄

12. **Model Building** 🤖

## 📖 TERMS USED IN NLP

1. **Document** 📝: Each row in the dataset is called a document.

2. **Corpus** 📚: Collection of all documents (all rows).

3. **Vocabulary** 🗂️: Unique words in the corpus.

4. **Segmentation** ✂️: Breaking multiple sentences into individual sentences.

5. **Tokenization** 🧩: Process of breaking a sentence into words; these words are called tokens.

6. **Stop Word** ⛔: Common words used in any language, e.g., "the," "is," etc.

7. **Stemming** 🌱: Removing or replacing suffixes of words to get the root or base word.

8. **Lemmatization** 📚: Similar to stemming but ensures the word has a dictionary meaning.

9. **NER Tagging** 🏷️: Process of adding named entity recognition tags to each word.

10. **POS Tagging** 🏷️: Process of adding Part of Speech (POS) tags to each word.

11. **Chunking** 🌳: Converting a sentence into a flat tree structure.
